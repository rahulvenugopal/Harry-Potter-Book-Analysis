## Trivia

1. There is a [course](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/fcondon/classes/popular-potter) offered by University of Waterloo called popular potter (engl 108p). Check out their [syllabus](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/sites/ca.scholar/files/fcondon/files/hp_pp_f2020_syllabus.pdf). I have never read a cool syllabus like this before!
2. ACCIO data is an infographic [book](https://www.blurb.com/books/8807266-accio-data) from Olivia Rouse. This 80 pages visual guide is a feast for any visual data story enthusiast
